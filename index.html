<h1>ELEVEN YEARS</h1>

<h2>GROWING UP WITH A BRAIN TUMOUR</h2>
<h3>By Matthew Lucas</h3>
</header>
</section>

<section class="start content">

<p>Alex loved football.</p>

<p>He had been kicking a ball about for almost as long as he could walk.  He was inseparable from his favourite Manchester United shirt.</p>

<p>Whilst celebrating his seventh birthday at a football party, a wayward shot caught Alex in the side of the head.  He collapsed to the floor, unable to get up.</p>

<p>When he stumbled back to his feet, showing signs of apparent concussion,  he couldn't stop his right hand from shaking.  His parents, Diana and David, took him to a doctor two days later when he started to close one eye and struggled to walk in a straight line.</p>

<p>Less than a week after his birthday party in February 2005, Alex was diagnosed with a tumour the size of a tennis ball towards the rear of his still-developing brain.</p>

<p>That same day he was rushed to hospital in preparation for an emergency 12-hour operation to remove the growth.  Whilst the surgery was a success, a small, inoperable part of the tumour will remain in his brain for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>For the last 11 years, Alex has faced regular MRI scans to monitor if the tumour has regrown.  Alex, Diana and David have been forced to live in the shadow of a disease which could one day return.  In sharing their different memories and experiences of this life-changing event, they give an insight into how such an indiscriminate illness can affect a family.</p>

<p>My parents held my hands as I went into the operating theatre.</p>

<p>I didn't understand why so many people had come to visit me.  I was so innocent and na√Øve to the enormity of what was happening. It would terrify me if it happened now.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed there were countless eye tests and coordination tests.  I couldn't even do simple things like touch my nose with my finger.  When I went back to school over a month later, I noticed people looking at the scar on my neck.  I knew they thought I wasn't normal.</p>

<p>My vision is perfect now, but there are some side-effects that I still have.</p>

<p>I can't play sports which rely on using my right hand, and when I go to the gym I struggle to lift weights on my right.  It's things like that which I notice from day to day.  Thankfully I'm left-handed so it's not a constant issue.</p>

<p>It's made me aware of my limitations.</p>

<br>
<p>I'm still a little conscious about the scars on my neck when I have short hair, but having grown older, the physical aspects don't bother me as much.</p>

<p>It's become normal life and part of who I am because it's been all I've known for so long. </p>

<p>It's just the way I am.</p>

<p>How would any parent react to being told that your seven-year-old has a brain tumour?</p>

<p>My worst memory of the whole experience was when I was alone in the hospital. A theatre-nurse came to me with paperwork, and simply said:</p>
<br>
<hr class="quoteline" align="center" width="40%">

<blockquote class="center">
  "There is a risk your son may not survive the operation"
</blockquote>
<hr class="quoteline" width="40%">
<br>
<p>I felt so awful, so vulnerable. It hit me like a bomb.</p>

<p>It was that moment I realised he might die.  It was the only time during the whole process that I cried.</p>

<p>Yet, generally, I felt an incredibly overwhelming sense of calm.  I certainly wasn't confident, but I found resources within me that I didn't know were there.  People would visit and at times be very emotional, but I would sit with Alex in the ward feeling peaceful.</p>

<p>I was so powerless, yet I had faith.</p>

<br>
<p>The past 11 years have been a constant shadow over the family.  Waiting for results of scans has become the hardest part.  You feel absolutely powerless.</p>

<p>Alex shouldn't have to live his life being reminded every year that he has a tumour that can come back at any point.</p>
<br>

<hr class="quoteline" align="center" width="40%">
<blockquote class="center">
  "You've always got to be prepared for the unexpected.  Even though you hope it won't be bad news, and we don't expect it to be, there is always that underlying fear"

<p>I didn't cope with the situation well at all, and I didn't have the belief and the faith that Diana had throughout the process.  Every time I thought about it I got very emotionally upset, angry and frustrated.  I cried a lot.</p>

<p>My typical reaction was, 'it's not fair, why him'. You look at this helpless little child who doesn't understand what's going on and you can't share it with him, you can't explain it to him.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>I'm fact based. I look at the statistics and I'm more of a pessimist. I tend to write the negative scenarios in my head.</p>

<p>Whilst it was very hard for the first few years because my son's life was in someone else's hands and I was in a situation completely out of my control, it's got easier with time.  I'm not as emotionally volatile now as I was at the beginning.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>Although the scans have become less regular, every time you still wonder what the result will be.  It'll never be all clear because the residual tumour will always be there.</p>

<p>I'll have mixed feelings if he gets discharged because at the moment we have the security that we know he's being monitored, so if they find something they can act on it.</p>

<br>

<hr class="quoteline" align="center" width="40%">
<blockquote class="center">
  "The scans bring it back, they always bring it back, but time passes and it's now 11 years on, so based on statistics, the risk of it returning is negligible"
</blockquote>
<hr class="quoteline" width="40%">
<br>

<p>If the scans stop, the safety net is gone. For so long that's what we've been used to, so perhaps the concern will grow again.</p>

<p>But we're not going to live our lives thinking it'll come back. We'll just go day by day and deal with things if and when they happen.  That's simply what you have to do.</p>
